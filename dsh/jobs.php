                        <p><b>Description:</b> NERC’s Digital Solutions programme was created to develop innovative digital services that deliver
                            economic, societal, and environmental benefits across the UK. It has been designed to move beyond just academic use and
                            exploitation of existing data holdings. Our ethos is to build a Digital Solutions Hub as a gateway to a broad set of
                            inter-connected toolkits that facilitate improved access and better use of NERC data. These may already exist, or will be
                            created with our partners, which include the NHS, Defra, PHE and HSE, as well as local and regional SMEs and individual members
                            of society. Providing easier access to NERC's environmental data offers opportunities for improving peoples' health and better
                            understanding the impacts of climate change on people, land, and property across the UK. Indeed, initially we will focus on two
                            areas 'Connected Healthy Nation' and 'A Climate Ready Nation' as use cases. It is expected, as the programme develops, more use
                            cases will come online.</p>
                        <p>We are interested in receiving applications from people who have extensive experience in the complete software engineering lifecycle
                            and who have a passion for supporting researchers. <strong>We are particularly keen to hear from people who have experience in one
