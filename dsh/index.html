            <h1>The Digital Solutions Programme</h1>
            <p class="lead">The Digital Solutions Programme is developing a digital <i>Hub</i> and set of toolkits that
                exploits environmental and other data (social, economic &amp; health) to create innovative digital
                services that deliver economic, societal and environmental benefits across the UK.
            </p>
            <p>Over the next 4&#188 years (from October 2021) the Hub will act as a gateway to a broad set of
                inter-connected toolkits that facilitate improved access and better use of NERC data. The digital
                platform will have especially broad impacts on the environment, society and the economy by facilitating
                easier access and use of NERC
                data in business, government and society. Working with our partners, who are the users of what we build,
                will help grow its use and dissemination. The Hub will be integrated with wider social, economic, health
                and environmental datasets, to support decision making across a range of sectors. For stakeholders, the
                Hub will be the user-facing entry point that allows them to explore what NERC offers, ensuring that data
                and toolkits are findable and accessible. Data science, and the integration it requires, are highly
                complex and constantly evolving. Our approach recognises that computational tools need to 'sit' in the
                appropriate place in the technical ecosystem, and that users, particularly those who are new, must be
                supported in using and accessing them.</p>
            <p>We will be working with a range of partners in local and national government, the private sector,
                technology sector, infrastructure providers, health sector, transportation, urban and regional planning,
                environmental science and a whole range of local and national agencies we will facilitate improved
                decision making in a wide range of sectors.</p>
            <p>The Hub will benefit society by improving decision makers' ability to make informed decisions through the
                integration of data that have potential benefits for the future prosperity of the UK. This ranges from
                local to national government, the NHS, utility sector, transport infrastructure, insurance industry,
                housing developers as well as individual members of society. Providing easier access to NERC's
                environmental data offers opportunities to improving peoples' health and better understanding the
                impacts of climate change on people, land and property across the UK.</p>
