                        <h5 class="card-title">The Digital Solutions Programme is developing a digital <i>Hub</i> and
                            set of
                            toolkits that
                            exploits environmental and other data (social, economic &amp; health) to create innovative
                            digital
                            services that deliver economic, societal and environmental benefits across the UK.</h5>
                        <p class="card-text">Over the next 4&#188 years (from October 2021) the Hub will act as a
                            gateway to a
                            broad
                            set of inter-connected toolkits that facilitate improved access and better use of NERC data.
                            The
                            digital
                            platform will have especially broad impacts on the environment, society and the economy by
                            facilitating
                            easier access and use of NERC
                            data in business, government and society. Working with our partners, who are the users of
                            what we
                            build,
                            will help grow its use and dissemination. The Hub will be integrated with wider social,
                            economic,
                            health
                            and environmental datasets, to support decision making across a range of sectors. For
                            stakeholders,
                            the
                            Hub will be the user-facing entry point that allows them to explore what NERC offers,
                            ensuring that
                            data
                            and toolkits are findable and accessible. Data science, and the integration it requires, are
                            highly
                            complex and constantly evolving. Our approach recognises that computational tools need to
                            'sit' in
                            the
                            appropriate place in the technical ecosystem, and that users, particularly those who are
                            new, must
                            be
                            supported in using and accessing them.</p>
                        <p class="card-text">We will be working with a range of partners in local and national
                            government, the
                            private sector,
                            technology sector, infrastructure providers, health sector, transportation, urban and
                            regional
                            planning,
                            environmental science and a whole range of local and national agencies we will facilitate
                            improved
                            decision making in a wide range of sectors.</p>
                        <p class="card-text">The Hub will benefit society by improving decision makers' ability to make
                            informed
                            decisions through the
                            integration of data that have potential benefits for the future prosperity of the UK. This
                            ranges
                            from
                            local to national government, the NHS, utility sector, transport infrastructure, insurance
                            industry,
                            housing developers as well as individual members of society. Providing easier access to
                            NERC's
                            environmental data offers opportunities to improving peoples' health and better
                            understanding the
                            impacts of climate change on people, land and property across the UK.</p>
